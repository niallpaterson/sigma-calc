# sigma-calc

A simple calculator app written in JavaScript that allows users to perform calculations in [sigma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summation#Capital-sigma_notation) and [pi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(mathematics)#:~:text=Product%20of%20sequences,is%20just%20that%20number%20itself) notation.

## Usage

Mostly self explanatory. Use the sigma and greek buttons to switch notation. 

Fill in upper and lower limits and enter calculation as desired.

By default the calculator is set to calculate in sigma notation with the lower and upper limits set to 1. 

This means that it works like a standard calculator out the box. 

## Future features

The following features are in the pipeline:

- Floating point number handling

- Exponentation functionality
